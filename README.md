## About
Hi, my name is Deanna. I am a senior studying Business Analytics and Finance at Boston University, set to graduate in May 2026. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong business foundation and a passion for working with complex data to identify patterns, uncover meaningful insights, and leverage analytics for decision making. 

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill set. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the excitement of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve real-world problems. Overall, I am eager to bring these technical and analytical skills to my future career.

This is a repository to showcase my skills and share my projects.

**Skills/Technologies Used:** Python, Data Cleaning, EDA, PCA, Pandas, Matplotlib, Linear Regression, KNN Regressor, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, K-Fold Cross-Validation  

### NHL Database  
**Table Creation Queries:** [Phase_II_Table_Creation.sql](./NHL_Database/Phase_II_Table_Creation.sql)  
**Data Insertion Queries:** [Phase_II_Data_Insertion.sql](./NHL_Database/Phase_II_Data_Insertion.sql)  
**Data Retrieval Queries:** [Phase_II_Queries.sql](./NHL_Database/Phase_II_Queries.sql)  

**Project Part I:** [NHL_Project_Phase_1_Redacted.pdf](./NHL_Database/NHL_Project_Phase_1_Redacted.pdf)  
**Project Part II:** [NHL_Project_Phase_2_Redacted.pdf](./NHL_Database/NHL_Project_Phase_2_Redacted.pdf)  

**Goal:** To design a database for our chosen domain, the National Hockey League. In Part I, we designed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for our proposed database, outlining key entities and relationships. In Part II, we then translated our ERD into a relational schema before creating the database with SQL queries. We populated this database with sample data and included several queries to justify how this database can be useful for managers in the NHL.  

**Skills/Technologies Used:** ERD, Lucidchart, SQL, pgAdmin, PostgreSQL, Joins, Aggregate Functions, Subqueries  

### Swift Shift Product Strategy
**Final Pitchbook:** [Swift_Shift_Pitchbook_Redacted.pdf](./Swift_Shift/Swift_Shift_Pitchbook_Redacted.pdf)  
**Final Excel Workbook:** [Swift_Shift_Integrated_Workbook.xlsx](./Swift_Shift/Swift_Shift_Integrated_Workbook.xlsx)  

**Goal:** To develop a develop and present a new product idea, culminating in a business plan that integrates financial, marketing, operational, and risk decisions. 

**Skills/Technologies Used:** Excel, Product Design, Market Research (Conjoint Analysis, Segmentation Tree, BASES Model), Financial Analysis (Three-Statement Financial Modeling, Financial Statement Analysis, Sensitivity Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulations), Operations Management (Capacity Analysis, Process Flow Optimation, Service Level Planning, Center Of Gravity Analysis), Strategic Marketing (Integrated Marketing Communications Planning, Social Media Strategy)
